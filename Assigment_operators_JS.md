## Different types of assignment operators in JavaScript and how they work:

## 1. The Assignment Operator (=)

The most basic assignment operator in JavaScript is the equals sign (=). It assigns the value on the right side of the operator to the variable on the left side. For example:

javascript
let x = 5;


In this case, the value 5 is assigned to the variable x.

## 2. Arithmetic Assignment Operators

JavaScript provides shorthand operators that combine arithmetic operations with assignment. These operators perform an arithmetic operation and assign the result to the variable. The available arithmetic assignment operators are:

- Addition Assignment (+=)
- Subtraction Assignment (-=)
- Multiplication Assignment (*=)
- Division Assignment (/=)
- Modulus Assignment (%=)

For example:

javascript
let x = 10;
x += 5; // x is now 15
x -= 3; // x is now 12
x *= 2; // x is now 24
x /= 4; // x is now 6
x %= 5; // x is now 1


## 3. Bitwise Assignment Operators

Bitwise assignment operators perform bitwise operations on variables and assign the result back to the variable. The available bitwise assignment operators are:

- Bitwise AND Assignment (&=)
- Bitwise OR Assignment (|=)
- Bitwise XOR Assignment (^=)
- Left Shift Assignment (<<=)
- Right Shift Assignment (>>=)
- Zero-fill Right Shift Assignment (>>>=)

For example:

javascript
let x = 5;
x &= 3; // x is now 1
x |= 2; // x is now 3
x ^= 4; // x is now 7
x <<= 2; // x is now 28
x >>= 1; // x is now 14
x >>>= 2; // x is now 3


## 4. Logical Assignment Operators

JavaScript also provides logical assignment operators that combine logical operations with assignment. These operators perform a logical operation and assign the result to the variable. The available logical assignment operators are:

- Logical AND Assignment (&&=)
- Logical OR Assignment (||=)

For example:

javascript
let x = true;
let y = false;
x &&= y; // x is now false
x ||= y; // x is still false
